## 📝 Introduction

This document outlines the system requirements and configurations necessary to ensure Amazon Music’s identity management system complies with GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, and future anticipated privacy regulations through 2025.

---

## 🌟 System Overview

### Purpose  
Upgrade the identity management system to ensure robust security and compliance with international data protection laws.

### Scope  
Includes all systems handling personal identification information (PII) of Amazon Music users across all operational regions.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

### Functional Requirements  
- **FR1:** Implement AES-256 encryption for all stored PII.  
- **FR2:** Support adaptive multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user logins, incorporating contextual factors.  
- **FR3:** Allow users to manage their PII (view, update, delete) in compliance with GDPR’s 'Right to be Forgotten' and similar CCPA provisions.  

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- **NFR1:** Achieve 99.999% uptime outside scheduled maintenance.  
- **NFR2:** Log all PII access and modifications with immutable timestamps.  
- **NFR3:** Ensure critical operations (e.g., authentication) meet stringent latency requirements (≤ 1 second).  

### Compliance Requirements  
- **CR1:** All data handling processes must comply with GDPR, particularly Articles on security of processing.  
- **CR2:** Facilitate handling of CCPA user requests within the stipulated 45-day period.
