### Introduction
This technical specification outlines the system requirements and configurations necessary to ensure Amazon Music’s identity management system complies with GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, and future anticipated privacy regulations up to 2025.

### System Overview
- **Purpose:** To upgrade the identity management system for robust security and compliance with international data protection laws.
- **Scope:** Includes all systems handling personal identification information (PII) of Amazon Music users across all operational regions.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- **FR1:** System shall implement AES-256 encryption for all stored PII.
- **FR2:** System shall support adaptive multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user logins, incorporating contextual factors.
- **FR3:** System shall allow users to manage their PII (view, update, and delete) in compliance with GDPR’s 'Right to be Forgotten' and similar CCPA provisions.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1:** System must achieve 99.999% uptime outside scheduled maintenance.
- **NFR2:** System must ensure all PII access and modifications are logged with immutable timestamps.
- **NFR3:** System must perform all critical operations under stringent latency requirements (e.g., authentication must complete within 1 second).

### Compliance Requirements
- **CR1:** All data handling processes must fully comply with GDPR, specifically Articles regarding the security of processing.
- **CR2:** System must facilitate the handling of CCPA user requests within the stipulated 45-day period.

#### Detailed System Components
- **Component 1:** Biometric Authentication System
  - **Function:** Validates user identity using biometric data (facial recognition, fingerprint).
  - **Specifications:** Must handle at least 200,000 transactions per day with failover capability.
- **Component 2:** Encryption Service
  - **Function:** Ensures data encryption both at rest and in transit.
  - **Specifications:** Must use industry-standard protocols (TLS 1.3 for transit, AES-256 for at rest).

- **Intrusion Detection System:** Specifications for real-time monitoring and response to potential security threats.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Outline the frequency and scope of security audits to ensure ongoing compliance and security integrity.

### Testing and Validation

#### Test Cases
- **Test Case 1:** Ensure encryption integrity of PII at rest.
- **Test Case 2:** Verify latency and accuracy of biometric authentication.
- **Test Case 3:** Test compliance of data deletion processes.

#### Test Plan
- Comprehensive test plan detailing phases including unit, integration, and system-level testing using automated tools in a CI/CD pipeline.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Initial Rollout:** Strategy for phased rollout, prioritizing compliance in the EU.
- **Monitoring and Feedback:** Detailed monitoring plan using cloud-native tools to ensure performance metrics are met and user feedback is systematically collected and acted upon.

### Maintenance and Support
- **System Updates:** Regular update cycle for security patches and functionality improvements.
- **User Support:** Outline the support structure for end-users, including privacy concerns and data management queries.
